Graduation Process for $CHONK9K Token

The $CHONK9K token graduation is a controlled deployment process secured via the following mechanisms:

Permission Model
	•	Graduation can only be triggered with a valid GRADUATION_KEY.
	•	GRADUATION_KEY must be securely stored as a GitHub Secret.
	•	Graduation workflow requires manual confirmation via GitHub Actions.

 Development Workflow
 	1.	Install dependencies

  	2.	Run tests
   pnpm test

   	3.	Execute graduation script locally (for development/testing)


Security Best Practices
	•	Never expose secrets in the codebase or logs.
	•	Limit permissions for users who can modify GitHub Secrets.
	•	Enforce branch protections and PR reviews for all changes.
	•	Audit GitHub Actions logs regularly.
